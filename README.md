For this task, I built a three-page responsive website using Bootstrap 5. I started by getting the basic HTML files set up for the home, about, and contact pages. I wanted the site to look really good and modern, not just like a basic example, so I used Gemini AI to help me. I asked it to give me better designs and the code for more attractive components, which included adding some custom CSS to make it look more polished. The main problem I had was a '404 File not found' error after I put the site on GitHub Pages. After checking everything, I realized I had forgotten to upload my actual HTML files to the repository. Once I uploaded them, the website started working perfectly. I learned a lot during this project, especially about how to troubleshoot deployment issues and make a site look more professional.
